# ISOLDE Loosely-coupled accelerator (LCA) model. 
## [REDMULE](https://github.com/ISOLDE-Project/redmule) hardware accelerator
Details about the accelerator are [here](https://github.com/ISOLDE-Project/redmule?tab=readme-ov-file#redmule)
## Prerequisites
in root folder execute
```
. ./eth.sh
```
## Building Simulation
default value for **IBEX_CONFIG**=*isolde*.  
For a list of possible configurations, see [ibex_configs.yaml](../../ibex_configs.yaml)  
in folder **isolde/simple_system**:  
* get a clean slate:
```
make veri-clean clean-test
```
or
```
make veri-clean clean-test-programs
```

## build the simulation and run the a test application
```
make TEST=fibonacci veri-clean verilate clean-test test-app run-test2
``` 
Output should be similar to this:  
```
TOP.tb_lca_system.u_top.u_ibex_tracer.unnamedblk2.unnamedblk3: Writing execution trace to trace_core_00000000.log
starting fib(15)...
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 1
fib(3) = 2
fib(4) = 3
fib(5) = 5
fib(6) = 8
fib(7) = 13
fib(8) = 21
fib(9) = 34
fib(10) = 55
fib(11) = 89
```
you can replace *fibonacci* with any test from isolde/sw/simple_system, e.g. make TEST=**dhrystone** veri-clean clean-test  verilate  test-app veri-run.  
Default test is **redmule_complex**.
**Examples**  
```sh
make TEST=vlinstr_test clean-test test-app run-test2

make TEST=vlinstr_test veri-clean verilate clean-test test-app run-test2
```

## build test app
* **gcc** toolchain
```
make golden
make sim-inputs
```
* **llvm** toolchain
*Not implemented*
 
# REDMULE testing
```sh
 make veri-clean verilate clean-test sim-input run-test2
```
Expected output:
```

# Ibex Simple System

Simple System gives you an Ibex based system simulated by Verilator that can
run stand-alone binaries. It contains:

* An Ibex Core
* A single memory for instructions and data
* A basic peripheral to write ASCII output to a file and halt simulation from software
* A basic timer peripheral capable of generating interrupts based on the RISC-V Machine Timer Registers (see RISC-V Privileged Specification, version 1.11, Section 3.1.10)
* A software framework to build programs for it

## Prerequisites

* [Verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator)
  Note Linux package managers may have Verilator but often a very old version
  that is not suitable. It is recommended Verilator is built from source.
* The Python dependencies of this repository.
  Install them with `pip3 install -U -r python-requirements.txt` from the
  repository root.
* RISC-V Compiler Toolchain - lowRISC provides a pre-built GCC based toolchain
  <https://github.com/lowRISC/lowrisc-toolchains/releases>
* libelf and its development libraries.
  On Debian/Ubuntu, install it by running `apt-get install libelf-dev`.
* srecord.
  On Debian/Ubuntu, install it by running `apt-get install srecord`.
  (Optional, needed for generating a vmem file)

## Building Simulation

The Simple System simulator binary can be built via FuseSoC. This can be built
with different configurations of Ibex, specified by parameters. To build the
"small" configuration, run the following command from the Ibex repository root.


```
fusesoc --cores-root=. run --target=sim --setup --build \
        lowrisc:ibex:ibex_simple_system $(util/ibex_config.py small fusesoc_opts)
```

To see performance counters other than the total number of instructions
executed, you will need to ask for a larger configuration. One possible example
comes from replacing `small` in the command above with `opentitan`.

## Building Software

Simple System related software can be found in `examples/sw/simple_system`.

To build the hello world example, from the Ibex reposistory root run:

```
make -C examples/sw/simple_system/hello_test
```

The compiled program is available at
`examples/sw/simple_system/hello_test/hello_test.elf`. The same directory also
contains a Verilog memory file (vmem file) to be used with some simulators.

To build new software make a copy of the `hello_test` directory named as desired.
Look inside the Makefile for further instructions.

If using a toolchain other than the lowRISC pre-built one
`examples/sw/simple_system/common/common.mk` may need altering to point to the
correct compiler binaries.

## Running the Simulator

Having built the simulator and software, from the Ibex repository root run:

```
./build/lowrisc_ibex_ibex_simple_system_0/sim-verilator/Vibex_simple_system [-t] --meminit=ram,<sw_elf_file>
```

`<sw_elf_file>` should be a path to an ELF file  (or alternatively a vmem file)
built as described above. Use
`./examples/sw/simple_system/hello_test/hello_test.elf` to run the `hello_test`
binary.

Pass `-t` to get an FST/VCD trace of execution that can be viewed with
[GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/).

By default a FST file is created in your current directory.

To produce a VCD file, remove the Verilator flags `--trace-fst` and
`-DVM_TRACE_FMT_FST` in ibex_simple_system.core before building the simulator
binary.

If using the `hello_test` binary the simulator will halt itself, outputting some
simulation statistics:

```
Simulation statistics
=====================
Executed cycles:  633
Wallclock time:   0.013 s
Simulation speed: 48692.3 cycles/s (48.6923 kHz)

Performance Counters
====================
Cycles:                     483
NONE:                       0
Instructions Retired:       266
LSU Busy:                   59
Fetch Wait:                 16
Loads:                      21
Stores:                     38
Jumps:                      46
Conditional Branches:       53
Taken Conditional Branches: 48
Compressed Instructions:    182
```

The simulator produces several output files

* `ibex_simple_system.log` - The ASCII output written via the output peripheral
* `ibex_simple_system_pcount.csv` - A CSV of the performance counters
* `trace_core_00000000.log` - An instruction trace of execution

## Simulating with Synopsys VCS

Similar to the Verilator flow the Simple System simulator binary can be built using:

```
fusesoc --cores-root=. run --target=sim --tool=vcs --setup --build lowrisc:ibex:ibex_simple_system --RV32E=0 --RV32M=ibex_pkg::RV32MFast --SRAMInitFile=`<sw_vmem_file>`
```

`<sw_vmem_file>` should be a path to a vmem file built as described above, use
`./examples/sw/simple_system/hello_test/hello_test.vmem` to run the `hello_test`
binary.

To run the simulator:

```
./build/lowrisc_ibex_ibex_simple_system_0/sim-vcs/lowrisc_ibex_ibex_simple_system_0
```

Pass `-gui` to use the DVE GUI.

## Simulating with Riviera-PRO

To build and run Simple System run:

```
fusesoc --cores-root=. run --target=sim --tool=rivierapro lowrisc:ibex:ibex_simple_system --RV32E=0 --RV32M=ibex_pkg::RV32MFast --SRAMInitFile=\"$(readlink -f <sw_vmem_file>)\"
```

`<sw_vmem_file>` should be a path to a vmem file built as described above, use
`./examples/sw/simple_system/hello_test/hello_test.vmem` to run the `hello_test`
binary.
